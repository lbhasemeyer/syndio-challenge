# Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

You need to have npm installed on your machine to run this app.

## Available Scripts

To get the project running and install dependencies, run:

### `npm install`

In the project directory, you can also run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

## If I had more time I would...
* Write more tests
* Have better git flow - write new code on branches, and merge those to master
* Add a redux flow (if handling more data / pages / calls)
* Use ul/li for the dropdown to better style the carrot and active state
* I only set one breakpoint - I like how this flows at all screen widths
* Less comparing against strings - use variables so less places to change if ever needed
